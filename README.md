Just some stuff that I occasionally work on

Branches are sorted by language

### Taken from the assignment:
Write a menu driven application that displays a menu and allows users to order food. The application displays a menu and asks the user to make a selection and provide quantity. It then calculates and displays the subtotal. The application keeps displaying the menu until the user enters the selection to Quit. Application then displays the subtotal, tax, tip and total and then quits.
