### Taken from the assignment

Create a program for Ms. Vashaw that will change the yield output for a given recipe. For example, if the given ingredients in a recipe serves 4, the program should be able to increase the amounts in the recipe to (double it or triple it) or reduce the amounts (half it or quarter it). The user should be able to input original ingredient quantities and recipeâ€™s yield, then using mathematical expressions, give the increase or decrease for that recipe based on what the user wants.
