1.
    Write a console application that compares two numbers in
    if statements and displays a summary of the comparison.

        Enter first integer: 45
        Enter second integer: 5
        45 != 5
        45 > 5
        45 >= 5

2.
    Write an application that takes three integers from user input and displays the sum, average, product, and smallest and largest of the numbers. Use the techniques from Fig. 3.22. [Note: The average calculation in this exercise should result in an integer representation of the average. So, if the sum of the values is 7, the average should be 2, not 2.3333….]

        Enter first integer: 200
        Enter second integer: 300
        Enter third integer: 100

        For the numbers 200, 300 and 100
        Largest is 300
        Smallest is 100
        Sum is 600
        Product is 6000000
        Average is 200

3.
    Using only the programming techniques you learned in this chapter, 
    write an application that calculates
    the squares and cubes of the numbers from 0 to 10 and 
    displays the resulting values in table format, as
    shown below. Only one variable, named x, should be created. 
    Use tabs (“\t”) between numbers to align
    outputted numbers 
    [Note: This application does not require any input from the user.]

        number     square    cube
        0         0         0
        1         1         1
        2         4         8
        3         9         27
        4         16        64
        5         25        125
        6         36        216
        7         49        343
        8         64        512
        9         81        729
        10        100       1000

    Hint:
    Write a Console.WriteLine statement which displays a number (num), its square (num * num)
    and its cube (num * num * num)  with int x;

4.
    Create a BMI calculator application that reads the user’s weight in pounds and height in inches (or, if
    you prefer, the user’s weight in kilograms and height in meters) from user input, then calculates and
    displays the user’s body mass index. The application should also display the following information from
    the Department of Health and Human Services/National Institutes of Health so the user can evaluate
    his/her BMI:

    BMI = weightInPounds × 703 / heightInInches × heightInInches
    Weight in pounds (lbs.) multiplied by the conversion factor 703 and then all is divided by
    height in inches (in) squared.

        Welcome to the body mass index (BMI) calculator
        Enter your weight in pounds: 165
        Enter your height in inches: 69
        Your BMI is: 24

        BMI VALUES
        Underweight: less than 18.5
        Normal: between 18.5 and 24.9
        Overweight: between 25 and 29.9
        Obese: 30 or greater

5.
    Write a program using a private method that includes a 
    loop to make a pattern like a pyramid with the numbers 0-10, 
    increasing by 1. (Bonus: pass an argument into the method).
       1 
      2 3 
     4 5 6 
    7 8 9 10

    Then, ask the user for color choice using an if/else if/else statement.
       1 
      2 3 
     4 5 6 
    7 8 9 10

    Finally, using a switch statement, have the program display 
    the pyramid using a single special character symbol 
    (symbols above the number keys) that the user inputs.
       * 
      * * 
     * * * 
    * * * *
